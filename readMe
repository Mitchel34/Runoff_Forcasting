MAC Python vm
TO get in: Source runoff_env/bin/activate
To get out: Deactivate

(Summary of Tasks)
* Data handling and preprocessing: Use libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
* Data visualization: Use Matplotlib or Seaborn.
* Deep-learning modeling: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch. Both have strong support for building and training neural networks.
* Model evaluation and error analysis: Leverage scikit-learn for metrics and possibly ensemble methods if needed.
