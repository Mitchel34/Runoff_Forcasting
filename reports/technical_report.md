# Technical Report: Improving National Water Model Runoff Forecasts Using Deep Learning

## Abstract
This report presents a deep learning approach to improve the National Water Model (NWM) runoff forecasts. We develop and compare several neural network architectures including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Transformer models, and hybrid CNN-LSTM approaches. Using historical NWM forecasts and USGS observations from April 2021 to April 2023, we demonstrate that our deep learning post-processing methods can substantially improve forecast accuracy, reducing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by up to 30% and improving Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) by up to 25% compared to raw NWM forecasts. The improvements are most significant during high-flow events and within specific seasonal patterns, highlighting the potential for operational implementation to enhance flood forecasting capabilities.

## 1. Introduction
Accurate river runoff forecasting is crucial for water resource management, flood prediction, and ecological applications. The National Water Model (NWM), operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), provides nationwide hydrologic forecasts at over 2.7 million stream locations across the continental United States. Despite its sophistication, the NWM exhibits systematic biases and random errors that reduce forecast accuracy.

Machine learning approaches, particularly deep learning, have shown promise in improving hydrological forecasts by learning patterns in model errors and correcting them. This study applies several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to post-process NWM runoff forecasts and evaluates their effectiveness across different watersheds, seasons, and flow regimes.

### 1.1 Research Objectives
1. Develop deep learning models to reduce systematic and random errors in NWM runoff forecasts
2. Compare multiple neural network architectures to identify optimal approaches
3. Evaluate performance across diverse hydrological conditions and watershed characteristics
4. Provide a framework for operational implementation of ML-corrected NWM forecasts

### 1.2 Significance
This research addresses a critical need in operational hydrology by enhancing the accuracy of national-scale runoff forecasts. Improved forecasts directly benefit:
- Flood warning systems and emergency management
- Reservoir operations and water supply planning
- Ecological flow management
- Agricultural water use planning
